    "## Setup  \n",
    "When you start the setup from the scratch with any of Windows, Linux or Mac OS, you are recommended to install the following:  \n",
    "- Python3 Latest (required)\n",
    "- Conda Environment (miniconda: recommended)\n",
    "- PIP (required even if you are using conda environment)\n",
    "- Python Libraries\n",
    "- Git Installation\n",
    "\n",
    "### Python3 Installation  \n",
    "- If you have Nvidia GTX or RTX GPU built-in your laptop, you can use your **Own Laptop** throughout the course.  \n",
    "- If you don't have Nvidia GTX or RTX GPU in your laptop, it is recommended to use your **Google Colab** instead since GPU processing is required in most deep learning trainings.  \n",
    "- We will use **Python3** throughout the lab. If you have lower versions of Python such as Python2, you have to install Python3 since a lot of syntaxes are different.  \n",
    "- To install Python3 package in your machine, please follow below instructions according to your OS.\n",
    "\n",
    "**For Windows Users**\n",
    "- Check the type of your processor architecture using `systeminfo | find \"System Type\"`\n",
    "- Go to https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/ and download the installation package (.exe file) according to your architecture type. \n",
    "- You can also check `python` or `python3` in your (conda prompt) terminal or command line before installing Python3 in your laptop. It will prompt you to the Python3 interpreter.  \n",
    "- To exit from Python3 interpreter, simple type `exit` or `exit()`.\n",

    "- Next, you need to install PIP(the Packages Installer for Python) in order to easily install python packages. To do so, run the command `sudo apt-get install python-pip` or `sudo apt-get install python3-pip`\n",
    "\n",
    "**For MacOS Users**\n",
