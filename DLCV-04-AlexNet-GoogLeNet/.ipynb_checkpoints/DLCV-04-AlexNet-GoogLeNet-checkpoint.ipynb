    "\n",
    "We create a new class that inherits from `Module`, then in most cases, we just need to override two methods: `__init__()` and `forward()`.\n",

    "`__init__()` is called the \"constructor\" of a class and is the method called on any Python object just after it is created, similar to constructors in Java or C++.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, constructors and instance methods work a little differently in Python than they do in Java or C++. The constructor is just an ordinary instance method that is only special in that it\n",
    "is called implicitly when the object is created. Instance methods in Python (methods called on an object) are distinguished from class methods (methods called on the class, not requiring any\n",
    "instance) by the presence or absence of the `self` keyword in the parameter list. In the body of an instance method, `self` is a reference to the instance the method was called on, same as\n",
    "`this` in Java or C++ or `self` in Ruby.\n",
    "\n",
    "Anther difference between Python and other languages is that object initialization in an inheritance hierarchy is more flexible.\n",
    "A constructor should normally call `super(ClassName, self).__init__()` (Python 2, also works in Python 3) or `super().__init__()` (Python 3 only) at the beginning of its\n",
    "own `__init__()` method to initialze any fields used by methods in the superclass, but it need not do so.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the case of a PyTorch `Module` subclass, we should call `super()` before doing other things.\n",
